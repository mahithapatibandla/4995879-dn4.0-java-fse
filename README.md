📌 Guidelines
Weekly work is maintained in separate folders with respective code and README files.

Each task is committed with clear and meaningful commit messages.

Folder naming convention: WeekX-TopicName (e.g., Week1-DesignPattern-DSA)

Ensure all code is clean, modular, and well-commented.

Weekly tasks will be updated in sync with the DN 4.0 program calendar.
